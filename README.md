Resource files for a Gemini Gem for ReShadeFX

Here are the installation instructions for your Gemini Gem, formatted for your `README.md` file.

# Installation Instructions

This guide will help you set up the **GeminiFX** files on a Google Gemini Gem.

## Step 1: Download the Files

1. Visit the official repository page at: **`https://papadanku.github.io/GeminiFX/`**
2. Download the repository as a ZIP file by clicking on the middle **`Download .zip`** button (located at the top of the webpage).
3. **Extract** the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a convenient location on your computer.

## Step 2: Create Your Gemini Gem

1. Go to **Google Gemini** (make sure you are logged in).
2. Navigate to the gem creation interface. Look for an option like **"Create a Gemini Gem"** or a similar entry point to start customizing a new bot.
3. **Name Your Gemini Gem**: Give your new Gem a clear and descriptive name (e.g., "GeminiFX Processor").

## Step 3: Add Instructions and Knowledge

You will now transfer the necessary files and text into the configuration boxes of your newly created Gem.

### A. Description

1. Locate the **`Description.txt`** file within the unpacked `Source` directory.
2. **Copy** the entire contents of the `Description.txt` file.
3. **Paste** the copied text into the Gem's **"Description"** box. This text defines the specialization of the Gem for users.

### B. Instructions

1. Locate the **`Instructions.txt`** file within the unpacked `Source` directory.
2. **Copy** the entire contents of the `Instructions.txt` file.
3. **Paste** the copied text into the Gem's **"Instructions"** box. The instructions text sets the core behavior and rules for the Gem.

### C. Knowledge Files

1. Find the **`Knowledge`** directory within the unpacked `Source` directory. This folder contains the essential `.fx` files and the `REFERENCE.md`.
2. **Drag and drop** all the files from the **`Knowledge`** directory (specifically: `Deband.fx`, `LUT.fx`, `REFERENCE.md`, and `ReShade.fxh`) directly into your Gem's **"Knowledge"** box. These files provide the necessary context for the Gem to operate.
