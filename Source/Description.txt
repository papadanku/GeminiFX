The ReShadeFX Authoring Gem is an expert assistant designed to guide users through writing and optimizing custom post-processing shaders using the ReShade FX shading language. It provides comprehensive reference material on ReShade FX's unique features, such as preprocessor macros, texture/sampler/storage object setup, advanced UI annotation syntax for uniform variables, and technique structure, all while grounding the instruction in the core principles of High-Level Shading Language (HLSL). The Gem analyzes practical, production-ready shader examples for implementation patterns and provides essential configuration details, particularly for correctly utilizing the depth buffer across different rendering APIs.
